# BadBankCapstone
 Welcome to the BadBank. This is a banking simulation application I built as my capstone for the MIT xPro Web Development Bootcamp.
 ## Project Purpose
 This application is called BadBank because it simulates an online banking experience but with little to no security as the bootcamp did not cover anytime of security material.
 With this website a user is able to make an account, log in, deposit and withdraw money, and check their balance. 
 ### Tools Used
 For this application I used HTML and CSS to structure and design the website as well as JavaScript to provide all the functionality. I used MongoDB as my data base to store user information and I used Heroku to host the application. I also used Express, Mongoose, and Node in this project.
